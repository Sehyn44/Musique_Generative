This is a Godot_v4.5 project

The goal is to create an engine to make procederal music via synthesis (no mp3 file played, all sound must be calculated via function)

The folder "python" contain .py file, they are just here to visualize function before implementing them to the godot project.

Full project made by Séverin RICHARD (student at cnam enjmin)
